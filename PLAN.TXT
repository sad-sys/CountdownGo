1) First a function that generates 4 numbers based on how many big numbers you choose 
    a) You input either a number and it generates that number of big numbers from 25, 50, 75, 100, if you input less than 0 or more than 4 it asks you to generate them again
    b) It generates the rest of the small numbers, numbers from 1-10
    c) It prints out the rest of the 4 numbers

2) A second function takes those numbers, and generates 6 - len(thatNumber) of small numbers (so between 2 and 5) --> Results in the introduction of the 


3) A third function generates a random number between 100 - 999

4) A fourth function does all possible calculations involving the exisitng numbers and anytime a result is within 10 of the target number it is printed, from most points to least points
    a) Vector of the 4 operations: +,-,/,*
    b) An outer for loops takes each number and runs all 4 operations, it then takes the next two numbers and runs
